Build a Static Site Generator

Let's build a static site generator from scratch!

Check out this live demo of what you'll build in this course! But you won't just build this site, you'll build the tool that builds this site. It's pretty meta. You'll also deploy yours to a live URL on the internet, just like mine.
What Is a Static Site Generator?

A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files).

Static sites are very popular in the real world for blogs and other content-heavy websites because they're lightning-fast, secure, and easy to host. For example, the Boot.dev Blog is a production-level static site generated with Hugo.
Static vs. Dynamic Sites

A static site is what it sounds like... static. The content is always the same. Users can not:

    Upload files
    Log in
    Leave comments
    Save preferences

You would need a dynamic site for that stuff, which is usually powered by a database and a custom web server. Static sites are great for:

    Blogs
    Portfolios
    Landing pages
    Documentation

Assignment

We'll be using the Boot.dev CLI to run and submit the CLI tests for some of the lessons in this project. Make sure you have it installed.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.
